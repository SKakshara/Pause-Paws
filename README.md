# Pause-Paws

Pause & Paws is an innovative website designed to provide on-demand mental health breaks for Rutgers students through the companionship of dogs. Users can schedule sessions where they have the opportunity to rent a dog for a predetermined period, whether it's a quick 30-minute break or a longer session.
During the session, students can engage in activities such as leisurely walks, playing fetch, or simply enjoying the company of their furry companion. The presence of a friendly dog can provide comfort, reduce stress, and promote relaxation, offering users a much-needed mental health break from their daily routine.
The service will be easily accessible with the Rutgers and local New Brunswick animal shelters and pet care clubs.


Initially, we worked towards using React to connect it with a database including animal shelters and listings of the dogs they cared for. This way, Rutgers students would have live access to shelters they could book dogs for.


We were receiving errors in both the front end and back end. Specifically, in connecting the backend database to the front end. Taking into consideration the amount of time we had left, we decided to improvise a simpler version of the code.

Utilizing Swift and X Code we created an iOS app that allows users to book an appointment with a dog. Pause & Paws also offers additional features such as ratings and reviews of animals from previous users, as well as tips for maximizing the therapeutic benefits of spending time with dogs. We also connect students with animals available for adoption, the app encourages pet adoption and supports local shelters and rescue organizations. It's a win-win situation where users can find comfort and support while giving a deserving dog a chance to find their forever home.

The service is free to use, but users have the option to make voluntary donations, which go directly to the shelters and rescue organizations supporting these animals available for adoption

In the future, we plan to add a login page, donation link, feedback location, emergency contact to the shelterâ€™s contact just in case something happens and contact to the animal shelters.
